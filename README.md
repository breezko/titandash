## Getting Started
Take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/becurrie/titandash/wiki) for information about setting up and configuring the dependencies and requirements needed to start the dashboard and initiate a new bot instance.

You can also visit our homepage, [here](https://titandash.net) for more information!

### Bootstrapper

  - Install all node packages from the `package.json` file.
  - Perform the database caching command to ensure it's setup properly.
  - Collect static files into the static directory.

- Display helpful error messages when any of the above processes fail.
