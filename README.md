## Getting Started
Take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/becurrie/titandash/wiki) for information about setting up and configuring the dependencies and requirements needed to start the dashboard and initiate a new bot instance.

You can also visit our homepage, [here](https://titanda.sh) for more information!

## Features

- Equip headgear based on your current highest levelled hero (melee, spell, ranged).
- Use/purchase a specific in game perk whenever you prestige.

### Bootstrapper
- Perform automatic updates as they are released directly from this page within the web application.
- Automate the following processes through the bootstrapper:
  - Updating titandash to the newest version.
  - Install python requirements taken from the `requirements.txt` file.
  - Install all node packages from the `package.json` file.
  - Perform the database caching command to ensure it's setup properly.
  - Collect static files into the static directory.
  - Perform dependency checks (`tesseract`, `redis`, `node`).
- Display helpful error messages when any of the above processes fail.
